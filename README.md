# Customer Segmentation: RFM vs KMeans

This project focuses on enhancing customer engagement for a UK-based online retail company by segmenting customers according to their purchasing behavior. Leveraging the publicly available Online Retail dataset from UCI, we performed an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to build customer profiles and applied KMeans clustering to group them into actionable segments.

This combined approach allowed us to distinguish between loyal customers, high-value spenders, and at-risk groups, providing a foundation for targeted marketing strategies and more efficient allocation of resources.

Key results highlight the existence of valuable clusters such as “Champions,” “Loyal Customers,” and “Big Spenders”, alongside vulnerable groups like “At Risk” and “Lost.” These insights enable the development of data-driven initiatives, including loyalty reward programs, personalized communication, and win-back campaigns, ultimately aiming to maximize customer retention and marketing ROI.
